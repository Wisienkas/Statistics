# Exercise 1 #

Desc: 
	How many cases are there in this data set? 
	For each variable, identify its data type.

Answer:

	>dim(cdc) > [1] 20000	9
	Appears there are 20000 Observations and 9 variables
	>names(cdc) 

	genhlth		:	Ordinal
	exerany		:	Regular Categorial
	htlhplan	:	Regular Categorial
	smoke100	:	Regular Categorial
	height		:	Discrete
	weight		:	Discrete
	wtdesire	:	Discrete
	age			:	Discrete
	gender		:	Regular Categorial

# Exercise 2 #

Desc: 
	a)	Create a numerical summary for height and age, and compute the interquartile range for each.
	b)	Compute the relative frequency distribution for gender and exerany.
	c)	How many males are in the sample?
	d)	What proportion of the sample reports being in excellent health?

Answer:
	a)	Create a numerical summary for height and age, and compute the interquartile range for each.
	>summary(cdc$height)

	Min		:	48
	1Q		:	64
	Median	:	67
	Mean	:	67.18
	3Q		:	70
	Max		:	93

	>summary(cdc$age)
	
	Min		:	18
	1Q		:	31
	Median	:	43
	Mean	:	45.07
	3Q		:	57
	Max		:	99

----------------
	b)	Compute the relative frequency distribution for gender and exerany.
	>table(cdc$gender) / (20000 / 100)

	Male	:	47.845 %
	Female	:	52.155 %

	>table(cdc$exerany)

	exercised last month(1)		:	74.57 %
	no exercise last month(0)	:	25.43 %

----------------
	c)	How many males are in the sample?
	>table(cdc$gender)

	Males	:	9569

----------------
	d)	What proportion of the sample reports being in excellent health?
	>sum(cdc$genhlth == "excellent") / 20000
	
	Proportion : 0.23285 to 1
	
# Exercise 3 #

Desc: What does the mosaic plot reveal about smoking habits and gender?

Answer:
	>mosaicplot(table(cdc$gender, cdc$smoke100))

	Reveals that according to the participants a little higher portion of the males smoke

# Exercise 4 #

Desc: 
	Create a new object called under23_and_smoke that contains all observations of respondents under
	the age of 23 that have smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.
	Write the command you used to create the new objec as the answer to this exercise.

Answer:
	> under23_and_smoke <- subset(cdc, cdc$age < 23 & cdc$smoke100 == 1)

	under23_and_smoke contains 620 Observations

# Exercise 5 #

Desc: 
	What does this box plot show?
	Pick another categorial variable from the data set and see how it relates to BMI. 
	List the variables you chose, wy you might think it would have a relationship to BMI,
		and indicate what the figure seems to suggest.

Answer: 
	>boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$genhlth)

	Shows that the BMI is negatively associated with the general health

	>boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$age)

	Shows how bmi effect people in different stages of life
	This reveals that People in their best age(30 to 70) seem to have a larger BMI than the really
		old people and the young people in generel of course.

# ON YOUR OWN (OYO)
#####

# OYO 1 #

Desc: 
	Make a scatterplot of weight versus desired weight.
	Describe the relationship between these two variables.

Answer:
	>plot(cdc$weight, cdc$wtdesire)

	Shows that theres a trend between the weight and the desired weight that is positive associated
	Additionally people in most cases desire to weight a little lower than their current weight

# OYO 2 #

Desc:
	Let's consider a new variable: the difference between desired weight(wtdesire) and 
		current weight(weight).
	Create this new variable by substracting the two columns in the data frame and assigning
		them to a new object called wdiff

Answer:
	>wdiff <- cdc$weight - cdc$wtdesire

# OYO 3 #

Desc: 
	What type of data is wdiff?
	If an observation wdiff is 0, what does this mean about the person's weight and desired weight?
	What if wdiff is negative or positive?

Answer:
	>typeof(wdiff) -> "Integer"
	
	In reality wdiff is an vector of Integers

	weight < wtdesire:
		They want to gain more weight.

	weight == wtdesire:
		They don't want to change their weight.

	weight > wtdesire:
		They want to loose weight.

# OYO 4 #

Desc:
	Describe the distribution of wdiff in terms of its center, shape and spread,
		including any plots you use.
	What does this tells us about how people feel about their current weight?

Answer:
	Graph looked at:
		Boxplot
		Scatterplot
		Histogram

	What appear is that people are really close to their own weight
	The general pop wants to lose a little weight, but it is really close in general

	The shape of the graphs are very limited to a small area where nearly all the results are the same
	It look quite symmetric on the histogram

# OYO 5 #

Desc:
	Using numerical summaries and a side by side box plot, determine if men tend to view their weight
		differently than women.

Answer:
	>boxplot(wdiff ~ cdc$gender)

	It appear that women in general want to lose weight more badly than males

# OYO 6 #

Desc:
	Now it's time to get creative. Find the mean and standard deviation of weight and determine what
		proportion of the weights are withing one standard deviation of the mean

Answer:
	Getting the mean
	>mean(cdc$weight) -> 169.683

	Getting the standard deviation
	>s_all = (cdc$weight - mean(cdc$weight) ^ 2
	>s2 <- sum(s_all) / length(cdc$weight)
	>s <- sqrt(s2)

	>s -> Standard deviation is 40.07997

	Getting the proportion
	>sum(abs(cdc$weight - mean(cdc$weight)) < s) / length(cdc$weight) -> 0.7076 -> 70.76 %

# OYO 7 #

Desc: 
	What concepts from the textbook are covered in this lab?
	What concepts, if any, are not covered in the textbook?
	Have you seen these concepts elsewhere?

Answer:
	Guess this is your own little experiment :)

	I Believe all the parts of the book attached this lab has been covered.
	The most important i think, was how to use '~' in boxplots and 
		the last assignment about the standard deviation.
	I've of course seen boxplot, Scatterplot and histograms in Math and used them at work to show
		performance in respect of responsetime to systems.
