# Lab 2: Probability 
###

# Exercise 1 #

Desc:
	What does a streak length of 1 mean, i.e. how many hits and mises are in a streak of 1?
	What is about a streak length of 0?

Answer:
	A streak of length 1 means that 1 hit in row hit, in general there are 0 misses in a streak of hits
	
	A streak of length 0, simple put means 0 hits in row.

# Exercise 2 #

Desc: 
	Describe the distribution of Kobe's streak lengths from the 2009 NBA finals.
	What was his typical streak length? 
	How long was his longest streak of baskets?

Answer:
	# 1 #
	Desc:
		Describe the distribution of Kobe's streak lengths from the 2009 NBA finals.

	Answer:
		It is right-skewed.
	# 2 #
	Desc: 
		What was his typical streak length?

	Answer:
		His typical was streaks of 0(0 followed by a 0),
		But since I wouldn't actually call that a streak, his most typical was streaks of 1

	# 3 #
	Desc: 
		How long was his longest streak of baskets?
	
	Answer:
		His Longest streak of basket was:
		>max(kobe_streak) -> '4'

# Exercise 3 #

Desc:
	In your simulation of flipping the unfair coin 100 times, how many flips came up heads?

Answer:
	>table(sim_unfair_coin)['heads'] -> '17'

# Exercise 4 #

Desc:
	What change needs to be made to the sample function so that it reflects a shooting percentage of 45%?
	Make this adjustment, then run a simulation to sample 133 shots.
	Assing the output of this simulation to a new object called sim_basket.

Answer:
	>sim_basket <- sample(outcomes, size = 133, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.45,0.55))

### ON YOUR OWN ###

Comparing Kobe Bryant to the Independent Shooter

Using calc_streak, compute the streak lengths of sim_basket.

# On Your Own 1. #

Desc:
	1. Describe the distribution of streak length. What is the typical streak length for this simulated
		independent shooter with a 45% shooting percentage?
	2. How long is the player's longest streak of baskets in 133 shots?

Answer:
	# 1 #
	The Distribution of streak lengths are right skewed. 
	The often occoured was 0, then 1, 2, 3, 7

	# 2 #
	The longest streak was 7

# On Your Own 2. #

Desc:
	If you were to run simulation of the independent shooter a second time, how would you expect its
		streak distribution to compare to the distribution above?

	Exactly the same?
	Somewhat similar?
	Titally different?

	Explain.

Answer:
	I would expect the result to be 'Somewhat similar' since the chances are the same, and they seems
		reasonable

# On Your Own 3. #

Desc:
	How does Kobe Bryant's distribution of streak lengths from page 2 compare to the distribution 
		of streak lengths for the simulated shooter? 
	Using this comparison, do you have evidence that the hot hand model fits Kobe's shooting patterns?
	Explain.

Answer:
	I would say the simulator is doing better than he does. It has less streaks of 0, and is more stable
	Meaning it is lesser right skewed than his results are. 

	I don't think the hot hand model fits Kobes shooting patterns at all, then he does worse than the
		normal model.
	If he was to fit the model, he would have a few more long streaks due to the increasing chance.

# On Your Own 4. #

Desc:
	What concepts from the textbook are covered in this lab? What concept, if any are not covered
		in the textbook? 
	Have you seen these concepts elsewhere, e.g. lecture, discussion section, previous labs, 
		or homework problems?
	Be specific in your answer.

Answer:
	Generally this lab covered sampling. Not much else was being covered.
