# Exercise 1 #

Desc:
	What command would you use to extract just the count of the girls baptized? 

Answer:
	> arbuthnot$girls (shows count for each year)
	Or for total sum
	> sum(arbuthnot$girls) (shows total for all years)

# Exercise 2 #
Desc:
	Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years?

Answer:
	> The plot shows that the number of girls baptized has increased over the years
	> it do however seems that in the 50's that a lot less was baptized.

# Exercise 3 #

Desc: 
	Now, make a plot of the proportion of boys over time. What do you see? Tip: If you
		use the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through your previous commands, your so-called
		command history. You can also access it by clicking on the history tab in the upper right panel.
	This will save you a lot of typing in the future.

Answer:
	> It appear that in general there are more boys than girls baptized

# ON YOUR OWN
######

The data are stored in a data frame called present.
	1. What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of the data frame 
		and what are the variable or column names?
	
	> present$year
	> dim(present)
	> names(present)

------------
	2. How do these counts compare to Arbuthnot’s? Are they on a similar scale?
	
	> (present$boys > present$girls) => all true
	> (arbuthnot$boys > arbuthnot$girls) => all true
	The result tells that for both observations more boys than girls was baptized

	The growth of boys and/or girls was not growing for the "present" dataset
	It was however growing in the "arbuthnot" dataset.
	
	The scale between boys and girls was almost the same for arbuthnot and present.
	arbuthnot(0.505 - 0.535)
	present(0.5115 - 5135)

------------
	3. Does Arbuthnot’s observation about boys being born in greater proportion than girls 
		hold up in the U.S.?
	
	> present$boys > present$girls => all true
	That tells us that for atleast the "present" dataset observation it holds

------------
	4. Make a plot that displays the boy-to-girl ratio for every year in the data set. What do you see?
	
	> plot(present$year, present$boys/(present$boys + present$girls), type="l")
	It shows that lesser and lesser boys are presented per girl, but it's only varying 0.2% over 60 years
	

------------
	5. In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.? You can refer 
		to the help files or the R
		reference card (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf ) 
		to find helpful commands.

	> present[which.max(present$boys + present$girls), "year"]

Contains homework thingies from Open Stratistics

# Exercise 1.1

Description:
	Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the year.
	Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group
	who had a stroke by the end of their first year.
	(Please note: answers to all in-text exercises are provided using footnotes.)²

Answer:
	> 45 / 244 > 0.2008929 %

# Example 1.6(Page 8 for graph)

Description:
	This Example examines the relationship between homeownership and the percent of units 
	in multi-unit structures (e.g. apartments, condos), which is visualized using a 
	scatterplot in figure 1.9. 
	
	Are these variables associated

Answer: They are negatively associate as it has the function form of f(x + 1) < f(x - 1)

# Example 1.12

Description:

Answer: 
	Stability 

# Exercise 1.21
