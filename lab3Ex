# Exercise 3.2 #

Desc:
	Area under the curve, 2. what percent of a standard normal distribution N(u = 0, sig = 1) is
		found in each region?
	Be sure to draw a graph.

Answer:
	
	# a: Z > -1.13
		
	> 1 - pnorm(-1.13)
	[1] 0.8707619

	# b: Z < 0.18
	
	> pnorm(0.18)
	[1] 0.5714237

	# c: Z > 8
	
	> 1 - pnorm(8)
	[1] 6.661338e-16

	# d: |Z| < 0.5
	> pnorm(0.5) - pnorm(-0.5)
	[1] 0.3829249

# Exercise 3.4 #

Desc:
	Triathlon times, Part 1 in triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender
		groups. Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo completed
		in the men, Ages 30-34 group while Mary competed in the Women, Ages 25-29 Group
	Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 ( 4948 seconds ), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53(5513s).
	Obviously Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective
		groups:

	The finishing times of the men Ages 30-34 group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a sd of 583 seconds
	The finishing time of women 25-29 group has a mean of 5263 seconds with sd 807 seconds.

	The distribution of finishing times for both groups are approximately Normal.

Answer:
	
	# a: Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.
	
	N(mean = 4313, sd = 583) for Men
	N(mean = 5261, sd = 807) for Women

	# b: What are the Z scores for Leo's and Mary's finshing times?
	# Lower is better
	
	For Leo
	>(4948 - 4313) / 583 = 1.089194
	
	For Mary
	>(5513 - 5261) / 807 = 0.3122677
	#	What do these Z scores tell you?
	It tells me that in their groups Mary did better than Leo.
 
	# c: Did Leo or Mary rank better in their respective groups? Explain your reasoning
	
	> Both did worse than the average

	# d: What percent of the triathletes did Leo finish faster than in his group?
	
	> 1 - pnorm(4948, mean = 4313, sd = 583) 
	[1] 0.1380342

	# e: What percent of the triathletes did Mary finish faster than in her group?
	
	> 1 - pnorm(5513, mean = 5261, sd = 807)
	[1] 0.3774186

	# f: if the distribution of finishing time are not nearly normal, would your answers to parts(b)
	# e: change? explain reasoning
	
	Well the whole normal distribution would be invalid and depending on the graph you would have a 
		different answer 

# Exercise 3.14 #

Desc:
	Find the SD. Find the standard deviation of the distribution in the following situations.
	
Answer:
	
	# a: MENSA is an organization whose members have IQs in the top 2% of the population. IQs are
	#	normally distributed with mean 100, and the minimum IQ score required for admission to MENSA
	#	is 132
	
	>qnorm(0.02) * -1
	so Z = 2.053749
	since "Z = (x - mean) / sd" it can be rewritten to "sd = (x - mean) / sd"
	
	> (132 - 100) / 2.053749
	sd = 15.58126
	
	# b: Cholesterol levels for women aged 20 to 34 follow an approximately normal distribution with
	#	mean 185 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Women with cholesterol levels above 220 mg/dl 
	#	are considered to have high cholesterol and about 18.5% of women fall into this category.
	
	>qnorm(0.185) * -1
	Z = 0.8964734
	
	> (220 - 185) / 0.8964734
	sd = 39.04187
