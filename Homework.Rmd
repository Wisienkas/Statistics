__Assingments Overview__:

- [1.1 - Migrane and acupuncture](#1.1)
- [1.6 - Smoking habits of UK residents](#1.6)
- [1.12 - Internet use and Life Expectations](#1.12)
- [1.21 - Exercise and Mental Health](#1.21)

### <a name="1.1"></a>1.1 Migrane and Acupuncture ###

Group     | Yes   | No   |  Total
----------|-------|------|---------
Treatment | 10    | 33   | 43
Control   | 2     | 44   | 46
Total     | 12    | 77   | 89

a. What percent of patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture? What percent is in the control group?

```{r}
{
treatment_pain_free <- 10 / 43
print("The percentage of patients in the treatment group which was pain free after 24 hours is: ")
print(treatment_pain_free) # Outputs: 0.2325581


control_pain_free <- 2 / 44
print("The percentage of patients in the control group which was pain free after 24 hours is: ")
print(control_pain_free) # Outputs: 0.04545455
}
```

b. At first glance, does acupuncture appear to be an effective treatment for migranes? Explain Your reasoning.

It does seem to be somewhat effective. But still not "a cure" since it's still only a very small portion of people it actually works on.
If it was used together with a lot of other options it might increase the overall total of people having migrane to be pain free

c. Do the data provide convincing evidence that there is a real pain reduciton for those patients in the treatment group

1 in 5 higher than those in the control group, seems somewhat convincing. There can't be said for certain that it wasn't just due to luck though. But there is a high chance that this for 1 in 4 was a real pain reduction.

### <a name="1.6"><a/>1.6 - Smoking habits of UK residents ###

Cigarette Habits    | gender  | age   | marital   | grossIncome   | smoke | amtWeekend  | amtWeekdays 
--------------------|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------|-------------|------------
1                   | Female  | 42    | Single    | Under £ 2600  | yes   | 12 cig/day  | 12 cig/day
2                   | Male    | 44    | Single    | $ 10400 - 15600 | No  | N/A         | N/A

a. What does each row of the matrix represent?

Each row of the matric represent an observation of a persons cigarette behaviour.
The information from each person is as the following:

- gender
- age
- marital
- grossIncome
- smoke
- amtWeekend
- amtWeekdays

b. How many participants were included in the survey?

Based on the table the survey had 1691 participants.

c. Indicate whatever each variable in the survey is numerical or categorical. If numerical, identify as continous or discrete. If categorical, indicate if the variable is ordinal

- gender:       Categorical -> Regular
- age:          Numerical   -> Discrete
- marital       Categorical -> Regular
- grossIncome   Categorical -> Ordinal OR Numberical -> Discrete... This one is debateable depending on how you handle it
- smoke         Categorical -> Regular
- amtWeekend    Numerical   -> Discrete
- amtWeekdays   Numerical   -> Discrete

### <a name="1.12"><a/>1.12 - Internet use and life expectations

A graph in book shows a graph with internet users (x - axis) and life expectations(y - axis) as a scatterplot illustrating life expections at birth as of 2012 and percentage of internet users in 2010 in 208 countries.

a. Describe the relationship between life expectations and internet users.

The relation ship is positively related.

b. What type of study is this?

Observational

c. State a possible confounding variable that might explain this relationship and describe its potential effect.

A varaible which increase the amount of internet users is the countries general wealth of people, since people with money have access to internet, these people also have higher life expectations because they are used to getting food each day and so on. 

### <a name="1.21"><a/>1.21 - Exercise and mental health

a. What kind of is this?

Experimental

b. What are the treatment and control group in this study?

Depending what you hypothesis is:
If you want to prove that more exercise do something then:
The treatment group is the people being assigned to perform exercise
The control groyp is the people being assigned to do nothing. 
else it is the other way around.

c. Do this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable

The age groups is the blocking variable.

d. Does this study make use of blinding? 

No, there is no placebo or otherwise confusions.

e. Comment on whatever or not the result of the study can be used to create a casual relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.

No. The study only takes place for 2 weeks. The effect on the mental health might only be temporary and decrease futher afterward, therefore there has to be a much longer study on the subject to conclude anything of use. 

f. Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal.

I would say that it should not be funded as it doesn't give anything.

- [1.40 - Marathon Winners](#1.40)
- [1.41 - Robust Statistic](#1.41)
- [1.50 - Heart transplant, Part 1](#1.50)
- [1.54 - Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part 2](#1.54)

### <a name="1.27"><a/>1.27 - Make up Exam

In a class of 25 students, 24 of them took an exam in class and 1 student
took a make-up exam the following day. The professor graded the first batch of 24 exams and
found an average score of 74 points with a standard deviation of 8.9 points. The student who took
the make-up the following day scored 64 points on the exam

a. Does the new student's score increase or decrease the average score?

Since the student on the following day scored lower than the average, 
he/she lowered the average of the 25 students.

b. What is the new average?

````{r}
{
  average <- 74
  students <- 25
  
  # The student of the following days 
  # part in  the total new average
  new_student_part <- (64 / (students))
  # The average with 25 students without the 
  # 25th students part
  new_average_part <- ((74 / students) * (students - 1))
  
  # The new average after the last students points 
  # has been added
  new_average <- new_student_part + new_average_part
  
  cat("The new average is: ")
  print(new_average)
}
```

c. Does the new student's score increase or decrease the standard deviation of the scores?

````{r}
{
  # Source for isolation: 
  # http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52820.html
  
  # Average from previous question
  average = new_average
  standard_deviation = 8.9
  # Now just the 24 students

### <a name="1.40"><a/>1.40 - Marathon Winners

 The histogram and box plots below show the distribution of finishing
times for male and female winners of the New York Marathon between 1970 and 1999.

<i>Figure in book page: 59</i>
</br>
</br>
<b>
a. What feature of the distribution are apparent in the histogram
  and not the box plot?
  What features are apparent in the box plot not in the histogram?
</b>
</br>
The histogram shows that there are 2 big groups of entries.
This is called a bimodal histogram. 

The Box plot shows the outliers and that there 
are no "lower" outliers.
</br>
</br>
<b>
b. What may be the reason for the bimodal distriution? Explain.
</b>
</br>
The reason that the histogram is bimodal might be because the entries
include both male and females.

Females do in general have less muscular mass and therefore they 
generally take longer to run a marathon.

So the two spikes are due to the most likely time for male and female.
</br>
</br>
<b>
c. Compare the distribution of marathon times for men and women 
  based on the box plot shown below. 
</b>
</br>
</br>
<i>Figure in book page: 59</i>

It is easy to see from the two box plots that women in general have
a higher time than males.

Also the females tend to be more spread than the males.
</br>
</br>
<b>
d. The time series plot shown below is another way to look at these data.
  Describe what is visible in this plot but not in the others.
</b>
</br>
</br>
<i>Figure in book page: 59</i>

This last graph shows the average of male and females for each year
instead of the sum of all the years as seen on the other models. 

This gives an idea about how the times for male and female changes each year. 

### <a name="1.41"><a/>1.41 - Robust statistics

The first histogram below shows the distribution of the yearly incomes
of 40 patrons at a college coffee shop. Suppose two new people 
walk into the coffee shop: one
making $225,000 and the other $250,000. The second histogram shows 
the new income distribution. Summary statistics are also provided.

<i>The figure is that should be here are found in the book page: 60</i>

a. Would the mean or the median best represent what we might think of as a typical income
for the 42 patrons at this coffee shop? What does this say about the robustness of the two measures?

The best way to still show the typical income of the now 42 patrons,
would be to take the median, as it would only have moved to the next 
entry of income for all the incomes as an ordered list, it would now 
pick the entry number 21 instead of entry 20. 

If the average was taken, it could if the 2 new had earned even more,
be moved beyond what the 3rd highest income patron was being paid. 
Which in this case would be a bad example to show. 

b.  Would the standard deviation or the IQR best represent the 
amount of variability in the incomes of the 42 patrons at this coffee 
shop? What does this say about the robustness of the two measures?

The IQR would just as the median be affected the least of the two
measurements. 
Therefore the IQR is more robust against far outliers.

### <a name="1.50"><a/>1.50 - Heart transplant, Part 1

The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was con-ducted 
to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program
increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated 
an official heart transplant candidate, meaning that
he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart.
Some patients got a transplant and some did not. 
The variable transplant indicates which group the patients 
were in; patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those 
in the control group did not. Another variable called survived was 
used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive at the 
end of the study. </br>
Figures may be found on the next page(<i>For this document the figure
is found on page: 64 in the book</i>)

a. Based on the mosaic plot, is survival independent of whether or 
not the patient got a trans-plant? Explain your reasoning.

Watching the Mosaic plot, The part alive was more than double for 
the patients receiving a heart transplant, than those who didn't

b.  What do the box plots suggest about the 
efficacy (effectiveness) of transplants?

The box plot gives information about how long the subjects what living
and it is clearly to see that those under treatment lived far longer 
and/or more often than those who didn't.

### <a name="1.54"><a/>1.54 - Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part 2

Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment compared to 
symptomatic treatment for acute sinusitis randomly assigned 166 adults 
diagnosed with sinusitis into two groups (as discussed in 
Exercise 1.2). Participants in the antibiotic group received a 10-day 
course of an antibiotic, and the rest received symptomatic treatments 
as a placebo. These pills had the same taste and packaging as the 
antibiotic. At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if 
they experienced improvement in symptoms since the beginning of the 
study. The distribution of responses is summarized below.

<i>Figure in the book on page: 67.</i>

a. What type of study is this?

It is an experiment, as the patients are given something from 
the study

b. Does this study make use of blinding?

Yes the patients are not aware if they are receiving a placebo pill
or the actual pill, therefore the study makes use of <b>blinding</b>

c. At first glance. does antibiotic or placebo appear to be more
efficient for the treamtent of sinusitis?
Explain your reasoning using appropriate statistics.

No. The control group and treatment group both have about the same 
percentage of improvements of symptoms.

d. There are two competing claims that this study is used to compare:
<b>The independence model</b> and <b>the alternative model.</b>
Write out these competing claims in easy-to-understand language and 
in the context of the application.
Hint: Researchers are studying the effectiveness of antibiotics.

e. Based on your finding in (c), does the evidence favor the 
alternative model? If not then explain why. 
If so what would you do to check if whether this is strong evidence?

## <a name="P1"><a/>Probability 1

__Assignment Overview__:

- [2.12 - School Absences](#2.12)
- [2.22 - Predisposition](#2.22)

### <a name="2.12"><a/>2.12 - School absences

Data collected at elementary schools in DeKalb county, GA suggest that each year roughly 25% of the students miss exactly one day of school, 15 % miss 2 days, and 28 % miss 3 or more days due to sickness.

a. What is the probability that a student choosen at random doesn't miss any days of school due to sickness this year

```{r}
{
  miss_1 <- 0.25
  miss_2 <- 0.15
  miss_3_plus <- 0.28

  miss_0 <- 1 - (miss_1 + miss_2 + miss_3_plus)

  cat("Percentage of students not missing any days: ")
  print(miss_0)
}
```

b. What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses no more than one day?

```{r}
{
  miss_1 <- 0.25
  miss_2 <- 0.15
  miss_3_plus <- 0.28
  miss_0 <- 1 - (miss_1 + miss_2 + miss_3_plus)

  cat("Percentage of students missing maximum of one day: ")
  print(miss_0 + miss_1)
}
```

c. What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses atleast one day ?

```{r}
{
  miss_1 <- 0.25
  miss_2 <- 0.15
  miss_3_plus <- 0.28
  miss_0 <- 1 - (miss_1 + miss_2 + miss_3_plus)

  cat("Percentage of students missing atleast one day: ")
  print(1 - miss_0)
}
```

d. If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what is the probability that neither kids will miss any school?

Assuming they are average kids
```{r}
{
  miss_1 <- 0.25
  miss_2 <- 0.15
  miss_3_plus <- 0.28
  miss_0 <- 1 - (miss_1 + miss_2 + miss_3_plus)

  cat("Percentage that neither kids will miss any school: ")
  print(miss_0 * miss_0)
}
```

e. If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what is the probability that both kids will miss some school, i.e. at least one day?

Assuming they are average kids
```{r}
{
  miss_1 <- 0.25
  miss_2 <- 0.15
  miss_3_plus <- 0.28
  miss_0 <- 1 - (miss_1 + miss_2 + miss_3_plus)

  cat("Percentage that neither kids will miss any school: ")
  print((1 - miss_0) ^ 2)
}
```

f. If you made an assumption in part (d) or (e), do you think it was reasonable?

Yes 

### <a name="1.6"><a/>2.22 - Predisposition for thrombosis

A genetic test is used to determine if people have a predisposition for thrombosis which is the formation of blood clot inside a blood vessel that obstruct the flow of blood through the circulatory system. It is believed that 3% of people
actually have this predisposition. The genetic test is 99% accurate if a person actually has the
predisposition, meaning that the probability of a positive test result when a person actually has
the predisposition is 0.99. The test is 98% accurate if a person does not have the predisposition.

What is the probability that a randomly selected person who tests positive for the predisposition
by the test actually has the predisposition?

```{r}
{
  infec_positive_acc <- 0.99
  infec_negative_acc <- 0.98
  infec <- 0.03

  not <- 0.97
  not_positive_acc <- 0.98
  not_negative_acc <- 0.02
  
  # Chance to get a positive result
  test_positive <- (infec * infec_positive_acc) + (not * not_negative_acc)
  
  # Chance that the positive result was actually not a false positive
  prob_infected <- (infec * infec_positive_acc) / test_positive
  
  cat("Chance for person to test positive and actually have it: ")
  print(prob_infected)
}
```

__Assignment Overview__:

- [2.28 - Sock in a Drawer](#2.28)
- [2.40 - Baggage Fees](#2.40)
- [2.46 - Income and Gender](#2.46)

### <a name="2.28"><a/>2.28 - Socks in a Drawer

In your sock drawer you have 4 blue, 5 gray and 3 black socks. Half asleep one morning you grab 2 socks at random and put them on.
Find the probability you end up wearing

__Rules for probability__:

- $P(a \bigwedge b) = P(a) * P(b)$

- $P(a \bigvee b) = P(a) + P(b) - P(a \bigwedge b)$

#### a. 2 blue socks

$P(1st Blue \bigwedge 2nd Blue)$

```{r}
{
  blue <- 4
  gray <- 5
  black <- 3
  
  count <- blue + gray + black
  
  prob_first_blue <- blue / count
  prob_second_blue <-  (blue - 1) / (count - 1)
  
  cat("Probability for 2 blue socks: ")
  print(prob_first_blue * prob_second_blue)
}
```

#### b. No gray socks

$P(\neg 1st gray \bigwedge \neg 2nd gray)$

```{r}
{
  blue <- 4
  gray <- 5
  black <- 3
  count <- blue + gray + black
  
  prob_first_not_gray <- (blue + black) / count
  prob_second_not_gray <-  (blue + black - 1) / (count - 1)
  
  cat("Probability for no gray socks: ")
  print(prob_first_not_gray * prob_second_not_gray)
}
```

#### c. At least 1 black sock

$P(1st Black \bigvee 2nd Black)$

but can be reduced further to (using De Morgan's law)

$1 - P(\neg 1st Black \bigwedge \neg 2nd Black)$

```{r}
{
  blue <- 4
  gray <- 5
  black <- 3
  
  count <- blue + gray + black
  
  prob_not_black <- ((blue + gray) / count) * ((blue + gray - 1) / (count - 1))
  
  cat("Probability for at least 1 black sock: ")
  print(prob_not_black)
}
```

#### d. A green sock

Since there is no green socks, the probability is Zero

#### e. Matching socks

$P(Blue_{Matching} \bigvee Gray_{Matching} \bigvee Black_{Matching})$

reduced to (using De Morgan's law)

$1 - P(\neg Matching Blue \bigwedge \neg Matching Gray \bigwedge \neg Matching Black)$

```{r}
{
  blue <- 4
  gray <- 5
  black <- 3
  
  count <- blue + gray + black
  
  prob_matching <- function(x, size){
    return (x / size) * ((x - 1) / (size - 1))
  }
  
  prob_not_blue <- 1 - prob_matching(blue, count)
  prob_not_gray <- 1 - prob_matching(gray, count)
  prob_not_black <- 1 - prob_matching(black, count)
  
  cat("Probability for a matching pair: ")
  print((prob_not_blue * prob_not_gray * prob_not_black))
}
```

### <a name="2.40"><a/>2.40 - Baggage fees ###

An airline charges the following baggage fees: $25 for the first bag and
$35 for the second. Suppose 54% of passengers have no checked luggage, 34% have one piece of
checked luggage and 12% have two pieces. We suppose a negligible portion of people check more
than two bags.

#### a. Build a probability model, compute the average revenue per passenger, and compute the
corresponding standard deviation.

```{r}
{
  observations = c(rep(25, times=34), rep(35, times=12), rep(0, times=(100 - 34 - 12)))
  
  mean <- mean(observations)
  sd <- sd(observations)
  
  cat("Mean is: ")
  print(mean)
  cat("Standard deviation is: ")
  print(sd)
}
{
  print("How raw data look as histogram")
  hist(observations, prob=TRUE)
  lines(density(observations))
}
{
  print("How a simulation with calculated standard deviation and mean")
  sim <- rnorm(n=100, mean=mean, sd=sd) 
  hist(sim, prob=TRUE)
  lines(density(sim))
}
```

#### b. About how much revenue should the airline expect for a flight of 120 passengers? With what
standard deviation? Note any assumptions you make and if you think they are justified.

### <a name="3.12"></a>3.12 - Speeding on the I-5, Part 1 ###

The distribution of passenger vehicle speeds traveling on
the Interstate 5 Freeway (I-5) in California is nearly normal with a mean of 72.6 miles/hour and a standard deviation of 4.78 miles/hour.

#### a. What percent of passenger vehicles travel slower than 80 miles/hour?

````{r}
{
  mph_mean <- 72.6
  mph_sd <- 4.78
  
  under_80 <- pnorm(q = 80, mean = mph_mean, sd = mph_sd)
  
  cat("Percent of passenger vehicles under 80 mph: ")
  cat(under_80)
  print(".")
}
```

#### b. What percent of passenger vehicles travel between 60 and 80 miles/hour?

````{r}
{
  mph_mean <- 72.6
  mph_sd <- 4.78
  
  under_80 <- pnorm(q = 80, mean = mph_mean, sd = mph_sd)
  under_60 <- pnorm(q = 60, mean = mph_mean, sd = mph_sd)
  
  cat("Percent of passenger vehicles under 80 mph: ")
  cat(under_80 - under_60)
  print(".")
}
```

#### c. How fast do the fastest 5% of passenger vehicles travel?

````{r}
{
  mph_mean <- 72.6
  mph_sd <- 4.78
  
  top5 <- qnorm(p = 0.95, mean = mph_mean, sd = mph_sd)
  
  cat("Speed of fastest 5% of passenger vehicles: ")
  cat(top5)
  print(" mph and above.")
}
```

#### d. The speed limit on this stretch of the I-5 is 70 miles/hour. Approximate what percentage of the passenger vehicles travel above the speed limit on this stretch of the I-5?

````{r}
{
  mph_mean <- 72.6
  mph_sd <- 4.78
  
  above70 <- pnorm(q = 70, mean = mph_mean, sd = mph_sd, lower.tail = F)
  
  cat("Part of passengers drivin over 70 mph: ")
  cat(above70)
  print(".")
}

### <a name="3.20"></a>3.20 - Heights of female college students, Part 2 ###

#### Exercise 3.18 lists the heights of 25 female college students. Do these data appear to follow a normal distribution? Explain your reasoning using the graphs provided below.

<i>Figures found in the book on page: 152</i>

Yes it seems to follow the normal distribution. With more samples 
however it would be even more likely to follow the normal 
distribution.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
