1. Explain	the	difference	between	an	experiment	and	an	observational	
study.

An Experiment gives treatments to the subjects 
An Experiment also has an control group, for comparison

An observation only observe variables on subjects

2. What	types	of	variables	are	there?	Explain	them.

Types of variables:

	* Numerical
		+ Continous( Can be any number ) 
		+ Discrete( Only Integers )
	* Categorical
		+ Ordinal( If you can rank the different variables and they are categorical)
		+ Regular (Gender, smoker etc)

3. What	is	random	sampling?

If a group of people has answered a few question and only a few of they answers are picked at random
that is random sampling.

4. What	is	random	assignment?

Random assignment is used in experimental studies, and is the practice of putting
participants in treatment or control group at random.

5. When	do	you	use	them	(experiments/observational	study)?

If I want to see if something new is working, you generally want to do
an experiment to test if the new invention or whatever work and how good, compared to
the current methods or nothing.

Observations are just observations of lets say the height of people and if they are smoking.
The study could then try to see if smoke and height is connected.

6. What	are	explanatory	and	response	variables?

	* explanatory: Other word for *Independent* variable
	  + Independent: Variable at input
	* reponse: Other word for *Dependant* variable
	  + Dependant: Variable at output, and is expected change if Independent change

7. Compare	mean	and	median,	in	which	cases	you	would	prefer	to	use	the	one	to the	other?

	* Mean: all the values summed and divided by the amount of values, Also known as *Average*
	  + Usage: If the values are clustered and doesn't have any far outliers
	* Median: The middle value of an ascending ordered list/set, take index 1 - 100, the median would be 50
	  + Usage: If there are extreme outliers

8. What	is	modality	and	skewness? Show	by	example.

	* Modality
	  + Unimodal: One Mountain
	  + Bimodal: two Mountains
	* Skewness: 
	  + Left skewed: All the values occour to the right
	  + Right skewed: All the values occour to the left

*Skewness*: 
	An example of skewness would be Income level of people in a country.
	Most of the people would have medium to low income, while a small part
	would earn an extreme amount of money.

*Modality*
	Height of people would follow the normal distribution and be uni-modal

9. What	is	standard	deviation	and	variance	and	how	do	they	relate?

	* Standard Deviation: Measures the variation from the mean
	  + High: Means the values are very spread
	  + Low: Means the values are very concentrated
	* Variance: Measures how far values are spread in the sample 
	   
*SD vs Variance*: 
	+ sqrt(variance) = Standard Deviation 
	+ Standard Deviation ^ 2 = Variance

10. Explain	the	law	of	large	numbers.

If the same study is continously conducted the result are increasingly more likely to 
be the expected result. 

11. What	is	a	sample	space?	Provide	example.

A complete set of all outcomes.

For 2 coint tosses the possible outcome would be:
{
	{Head, Head},
	{Head, Tail},
	{Tail, Head},
	{Tail, Tail}
}

12. When	are	two	processes	independent?

When they have nothing to do with each other

13. Explain	the	concept	of	conditional	probability	and	show	how	you	calculate	it.

P(6 on first dice AND 5 on second dice) = P(6 on first dice) * P(5 on second dice)

P(E1 OR E2) = P(E1) + P(E2)

P(E1 AND E2) = P(E1) * P(E2)

14. What	is	important	when	sampling	from	a	small	population?

Atleast:
	+ 10 success
	+ 10 failures
	+ n >= 30

15. What	is	a	random	variable (RV)?	What	is	an	expected	value	of	a	RV?

A random value is a random value is random value.

It is generated due to chance on a set of different values.

The expected value is the highest probability

16. What is	the	probability	for	an exact value of a	RV that	follows	a continuous distribution? Explain.

Very low.

Since continous has an infinity of possibilities even for a small concentration and exact value 
is hard to hit spot on.

17. Draw	and	describe	the	normal	distribution.

It is a symmetric mountain

18. What	is	a	Z-value?	How	do	we	calculate	it?

The Z value describe the chance that an observation at that Z and futher away from the center 
will happen, based on the mean and standard deviation, where the mean is the center.

The standard deviation correspond to 1 Z 

19. What	is	the	68-95-99.7	rule?

Rule used to remember to remember the first 3 standard deviations boundaries.

20. What	is	a	Q-Q	plot?	Why do	we	use	it?

The Q-Q plot is a graph which is liniar for the normal distributions and shows the values 
according to the normal distribution.

21. Describe the geometric distribution.

It describes the probability for getting x success in n trials

22. What is	a Bernoulli	RV?

1 / p = average for success

23. Describe	the	binomial	distribution.

It describes the chance from a point x to an extreme (max or min) given a mean and a standard deviation
and n


24. What	is	a	sampling	distribution?

It is a subset of random entries from the a whole population of which nearly shows the whole population
but shows with a sample.

25. Explain	the	Central	Limit	Theorem.

Says that a sample is large enough if any of the following is true:

	+ Distribution is nearly normal
	+ If unimodel etc, sample size less than 15, symmetric, unimodal and no outliers
	+ Skewed with between 16 to 40 n
	+ Sample size greater than 40

26. What	is	a	Confidence	Interval	and	how	is	it	calculated?

Point estimate +/- Z * Standard error

27. Explain	the	process	of hypothesis testing for population mean.

Null Hypthesis and Alternative Hypthesis

28. What	is	a	p-value?

the value corresponding to how many standard errors away the null hypothesis is from the data

29. What	types	of	errors	you	can	make	in	hypothesis	testing?	Explain	them.

Type 1 error: If reject null hyp if it was true
	denoted by Alpha

Type 2 error: If accept null hyp if it was false
	denoted by Beta

30. What	are	the	two	main	conditions	that	statistical	tools	rely	on?



31. What	is	a	power	of	a	test?

The probability that it correctly reject the null Hypthesis then it is false.

32. What	are	statistical	and	practical	significance?

When it is decided it is unlikely to have happened by chance


33. What	is	paired	data?

Paired data is when the same person makes multiple tests and those is compared

For paired data often the difference of the data is taken

34. What differs	in	the	inference	methods that we	use	for	difference	of	paired and non-paired	data?


35. What	inference	methods	can	we	use	for	comparing	two	groups	of	numerical	data?	What	about	3+	groups?	How	do	we	calculate	variance	for	each	case?	Explain	the	inference	processes	and	test	statistics	for	each	case. What	are	the	conditions	for	each	method?



36. Explain the	inference	method	for	categorical	data	for	single	proportion.  What	are	the	conditions	for	this	inference	method?
