# Exercise 2.2 #

Desc: 
	The game of roulette involves spinning a wheel with 38 slots: 18 red , 18 black and 2 green.
	A ball is spun onto the wheel and will eventually land in a slot, where each slot has an equal
		chance of capturing the ball

Subparts:
	
	a) ----
		desc:
			You watch a roulette wheel spin 3 consecutive times and the ball lands on a red slot each
			time. 
			What is the probability that the ball will land on a red slot on the next spin?

		Answer:
			The Probability for the ball landing on the red slot is:
			18 / 38 => 0.474

	b) ----
		desc: 
			You watch a roulette wheel spin 300 consecutive times and the ball lands on a red slot
			each time.
			What is the probability that the ball will land on a red slot the next spin?
		Answer:
			The Probability for the ball landing on the red slot is:
			18 / 38 => 0.474
			Same as before. Not saying anything about dependency on previous

	c) ----
		desc:
			Are you equally confident of your answers to parts (a) and (b)
		Answer:
			Yes

# Exercise 2.6 #

Desc:
	If you roll a pair of fair dice, what is the probability of

Subparts:
	
	a) ----
		desc:
			Getting a sum of 1?
		Answer:
			Since each dice will have 1 as the lowest value the sum would always be higher than 1
			The answer is therefor that the sum of 1 is not a part of the probability-set 
				meaning it's void or 0 
	b) ----
		Desc: 
			Getting a sum of 5?
		Answer:
			there are 36 possible outcomes
			to get 5 you have the following sets
			{(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)} 
			you'll then have 4 out of 36 => 4 / 36

	c) ----
		Desc:
			Getting a sum of 12?
		Answer:
			only 1 out of the 36 outcomes result in 2 * 6. meaning the probability is 1 in 36 => 1 / 36

# Exercise 2.10 #

Desc: 
	Guessing on an exam.
	In a multiple choice exam, there are 5 questions and 4 choices for each question (a,b,c,d).
	Nancy as not studied for the exam at all and decides to randomly guess the answers.
	What is the probability that:

Subparts:

	a) ----
		Desc: 
			The first question she gets right is the 5th question?
		Answer:
			Meaning the first 4 would be wrong. Assuming only 1 of the choices (a,b,c,d) is correct.
			Futher assuming she took the questions in accending order: '1 then 2 then 3 ...'
			the chance for failure is thereby 0.75 for each question, so for getting to 
				the last question without anything right would be 0.75 ^ 4.
			For then answering the last one correct would be 0.25:
			
			The final result is then:
			P(first question right in 5th question) 
			=> (0.75 ^ 4) * 0.25 
			=> 0.079101563
	
	b) ----
		Desc:
			She gets all of the questions right?
		Answer:
			Assuming only 1 of (a,b,c,d) is correct foreach question.
			
			P(all correct) = 0.25 ^ 5

	c) ----
		Desc: 
			She gets at least one question right?
		Answer:
			Assuming only 1 of (a,b,c,d) is correct foreach question.
			
			P( > 0 correct) = 1 - 0.75 ^ 5 = 0.762695313

# Exercise 2.16 #

Desc: 
	PB & J. Suppose 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly, and 78% like both.

	Given that a random sampled person likes panut butter, 
		what's the probability that he also likes jelly?

Answer:
	P(j|pb) => P(j & pb) / P(pb) => 0.78 / 0.8
